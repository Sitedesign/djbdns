    for those doing quiet installations.

 -- Adam D. McKenna <adam@debian.org>  Tue, 28 Jan 2003 18:42:14 -0800

djbdns (1.05-8) unstable; urgency=low

djbdns (1.05-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Work Stinks" release.
  * Got rid of all the debconf stuff in postinst -- djb's conf-* utilities
    make it braindead-easy enough for people to configure their DNS system.
  * After creating the daemontools-installer package, I have decided that
    I like the installer package better than the source package.  It's
    smaller, and it can go into contrib (instead of non-free).

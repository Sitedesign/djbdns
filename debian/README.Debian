dnscache for Debian
----------------------

The following are differences between an unmodified binary installation of
dnscache, and the one installed by this package:

- added "clean" target in Makefile
- @ and VERSION install to /usr/share/dnscache instead of
/usr/etc/dnscache to comply with FHS
- binaries install to /usr instead of /usr/local
